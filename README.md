## Well how do I install it?

Click the button below to fork into IBM DevOps Services and deploy your own copy of this application on Bluemix. Note the app will not yet work; you need to set the environment variables in bluemix and set up the slash command in slack.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jroyal/RTC-Slackbot.git)

#### Setting up the slash command

Go to to your slack settings where you can add integrations, and add a new slash command. Add your new Bluemix url that you got from your deploy to the URL field. Set up the command to /rtc or whatever else you might want. Copy down your token because you will need it in the next step.

#### Setting the environment variables

Go to the [Bluemix Dashboard](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/?ace_base=true). Click on the tile that represents your new application. In the left side bar, click on `environment variables` and then in the center of the screen `USER_DEFINED`. Set the following variables.

| *Variable*   | *Explanation* |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| *JAZZ_URL* | The first part of the url of your track and plan. Ex: https://hub.jazz.net/ccm08   |
| *JAZZ_USERNAME* | Your IBM Single Sign on Username   |
| *JAZZ_PASSWORD* | Your IBM Single Sign on Password   |
| *SLACK_TOKEN* | The token generated by your slack slash command   |
| *SLACK_ERROR_URL* | *Optional* The url to a incoming webhook used to post error messages   |
| *SLACK_ERROR_CHANNEL* | *Optional* The channel to post the error messages too   |

#### Optional Error Updates

I added the ability for a user or channel to be notified if something would have caused a server error. This was essentially so I could see if someone tried a request that failed for a reason that I didn't expect. If you would like to get this functionality create a new incoming webhook and set the two optional env variables listed in the table above.

#### Can I install it locally?

Yes you can. The only thing you will need to do is fill out the env-sample.yaml and change the name to env.yaml. That should allow you to run the code locally. You can then send REST calls to http://localhost:5000 that spoof the /rtc calls. The payload should look something like this

### Suggestions or bugs?

Go and make an issue and tag it as a bug or enhancement. I will try to get an update out for bugs as soon as I can, and I'll do my best to add enhancements. Better yet, if you have a fix create a pull request with your fix! :)
